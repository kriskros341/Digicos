A website made for Digicos S.A. website contest. After ditching wordpress, it went through many iterations. I Initially started with React and FastAPI + MongoDB. As the project grew I made a version of it in Next.js and switched to Typescript.

Project includes a custom CMS and I had a lot of fun with it
